# Tandem Assignment

This is a stoppage visualizer web app created using React.js which allows the users to identify and visualize stoppages on a map using the GPS data as an input(.xlsx file).

Initially all the markers with stoppage duration of 0 or more minutes are visible, the user-defined threshold value is taken as the input and the markers are rendered accordingly.

Steps to use the app:
- Upload the excel file containing the GPS data.
- Enter the threshold value in the input box.
